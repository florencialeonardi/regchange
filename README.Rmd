# regchange

The goal of `regchange` is to fit a linear regression model with change-points in the regression coefficients by a regularized least squares criterion. The algorithm computes the exact solution by using a dynamic programming approach or a local optimum
by a binary segmentation method.

## Installation

You can install this version of `regchange` with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("florencialeonardi/regchange")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regchange)
x <- matrix(runif(150), ncol=3, nrow=50)
y <- x%*%c(1,0,0)+rnorm(50, 0.01)
fit <- regchange(x,y)
```
